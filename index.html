			The earliest type of machine used for computing was the abacus, dating back to possibly 3000 b.c. in Babylon. Still used in the 1990s, it was a simple system of beads that slid on wires. The next major improvement was made by Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) in 1642, when he developed a "mechanical adding machine" he called the Pascaline. In 1694, Gottfried Wilhem von Leibniz (1646–1716) made changes to the Pascaline so it could multiply as well. An Englishman named Charles Babbage (1791–1871) designed the first modern computer. Named the Analytical Engine, it used punched cards. American Herman Hollerith (1860–1929) used the punched card technique to make a machine for use in tabulating results of the U.S. Census in 1890.
			He founded the Tabulating Machine Co. in 1896, which became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924. Dr. John V. Atanasoff and assistant Clifford Berry developed the

                   From this point, computer history was marked by "generations." The first generation of computers featured the use of vacuum tubes, which contributed to their characteristically huge size. Another limitation was their
				   programming language. This period lasted roughly from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s. The second generation, approximately mid- to late-1950s to the early-1960s, saw the use of the transistor instead of the large vacuum tubes.
				   This led to smaller, more efficient, and less costly machines. Improvements in programming language gave them greater flexibility. This generation of hardware generated new jobs in the computer industry such as 
				   programmers and software developers.</p>
